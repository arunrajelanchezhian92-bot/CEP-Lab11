# **Exercise 1: Resume Screening AI Bias Analysis**

## **Step 1: Basic Statistics**

### **1. Interview Rate (AI Decision)**

* Males scoring 70+: 46 out of 50 = 92%
* Females scoring 70+: 24 out of 50 = 48%

### **2. Actual Qualification Rate**

* Males: 38/50 = 76%
* Females: 35/50 = 70%


## **Step 2: Bias Analysis**

### **3. AI Accuracy by Group**

* Qualified males correctly identified: ~35
* Qualified females correctly identified: ~17
* AI Accuracy (males): 92%
* AI Accuracy (females): 49%

### **4. False Negatives (Qualified but Rejected)**

* Male false negatives: 3
* Female false negatives: 18


## **Step 3: Impact Assessment**

### **5. Hiring Impact**

Based on AI interview proportions:

* Males: ~13 hires
* Females: ~7 hires

This is not proportional to the actual qualification levels.


## **Step 4: Reflection Questions**

### **6. Bias Evidence**

There is clear gender bias: men receive interviews at nearly double the rate of women, and qualified female candidates are rejected much more often.

### **7. How the Bias Developed**

Possible causes:

* Biased or unbalanced training data
* Historical hiring bias encoded into the AI
* Features that indirectly encode gender differences
* Lack of fairness testing during development

### **8. Recommendations**

* Use balanced datasets
* Run fairness audits
* Remove or adjust biased features
* Add human oversight
* Apply bias-mitigation techniques (e.g., equalized odds)


# **Exercise 2: AI Decision Transparency Testing**

## **Reflection Responses**

### **1. Emotional Impact**

* Round 1: Felt frustrated and unfair due to lack of explanation
* Round 2: Felt clearer, more transparent, and more respectful

### **2. Understanding**

Round 2 provided:

* Reasons for the decision
* Scoring breakdown
* Clear improvement steps

### **3. Trust**

The transparent AI system is more trustworthy because it:

* Explains decisions
* Allows accountability
* Helps users understand the process

### **4. Actionability**

Round 2 provided specific steps to improve:

* Submit standardized test scores
* Add leadership roles
* Strengthen weaker areas

### **5. Programming Implications**

* Explainable AI supports fairness and user trust
* Challenges: complexity, risk of gaming the system
* Lack of transparency can cause ethical issues and discrimination
